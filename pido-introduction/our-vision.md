# Our Vision

By harnessing the power of the crypto economy, Pido aims to redefine the relationship between designers/artists and their creations.

## Future of Affordable Creations

* Pido empowers independent designers/artists to promote their creations through a unique business model, reducing their financial costs and fostering a more comprehensive development of the design/art market.
* Utilizing blockchain technology and decentralization principles, Pido ensures that designers/artists on the platform enjoy protected rights for their creations while expanding the transaction boundaries and potential value of their work.

## Transparent Recommendations and Universal Curators/Buyers

* Pido opposes the current uneven distribution of resources on social platforms, aiming to establish a fair, new recommendation system using blockchain technology, ensuring equal opportunities and resource allocation.
* Pido encourages consumers to become unique trendsetters by offering them profit opportunities, elevating the aesthetic level of Pido users, and promoting greater liquidity within the platform for creative works.

## The Innovation of Crypto-Economic Systems

* Pido innovatively adopts a multi-token model to enhance the stability of the economic system. Diverse mining mechanisms increase user engagement, and the introduction of Harberger Tax promotes liquidity in the secondary market. This cryptoeconomic system shapes the future of digital creative platforms.
* By digitizing real-world assets, Pido addresses multiple challenges in the design/art market, including pricing, manual vs. mass production, sales, collection, rights confirmation, and exposure. Leveraging new technologies and innovative production and sales models, Pido supports creators in establishing themselves in the future.

## Pido's Vision

Pido's vision is to establish a web3-based creative hub. We aim to build a sustainable ecosystem that not only supports creators in receiving fair rewards but also invites the community to actively participate throughout the entire creative process, sharing the outcomes and enhancing the aesthetic and ownership awareness of community users. Pido seeks to be a bridge connecting the virtual and real worlds, seamlessly integrating blockchain technology with creative art. From this perspective, we believe that Pido is not just a participant in the future creative retail landscape but a potential disruptor and innovator. By combining the principles of Web 3.0 with the traditional market for creative goods, Pido has the potential to fundamentally change our perception and interaction with creative retail, paving the way for a more decentralized, user-centric future.
