# Web3 Investors' Dilemmas

Challenges faced by Web3 investors include:

1. **Low NFT liquidity:** The NFT market experiences limited liquidity, resulting in relatively inefficient transactions. This may inconvenience investors when they need to swiftly buy or sell assets.
2. **Speculative nature:** The NFT market exhibits a strong speculative nature, with prices influenced significantly by market factors and speculative behaviors, introducing higher risks for investors.
3. **Cyclicality and volatility of cryptocurrencies:** Cryptocurrency markets display distinct cycles and high volatility, requiring investors to handle market fluctuations cautiously to avoid potential risks.
4. **Difficulty in acquiring tangible assets:** Cryptocurrency investors often face challenges in directly acquiring corresponding tangible assets. This limitation may restrict their avenues for realizing investment returns in the physical world.

These challenges underscore the need for solutions addressing NFT market liquidity, mitigating speculative risks, and facilitating more accessible acquisition of tangible assets for investors.
