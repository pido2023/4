# Pido Solutions

Pido's detailed solutions includes four innovative approaches to address the challenges faced by different players in the Web3 independent creation market:

## **Blockchain-based Applications and NFT Meta-assets**

Pido fully leverages blockchain technology, tightly binding virtual NFTs with real-world creations through NFT meta-assets. This innovative solution assigns a unique digital identity to each piece, ensuring the designer/artist's intellectual property rights and establishing a seamless connection between the virtual and real worlds.

## **Combined Auction and Crowdfunding Business Model**

Pido introduces intelligent auction and crowdfunding mechanisms, providing creators with an opportunity to understand market demand before production. This business model helps creators avoid overproduction and inventory issues while offering users a way to collaborate with and support designers/artists.

## **Buyer System and Transparent Recommendation System**

Pido innovatively introduces a buyer system, allowing users with a discerning eye to become advocates for the platform. Through the transparency of blockchain, the recommendation system becomes fair and traceable, enabling creators to gain more exposure while users contribute their unique aesthetic perspectives to the platform.

## **Multi-token Economic System and Web3 Community Governance**

Pido not only introduces a multi-token economic system, allowing creators and users to engage in the platform's ecosystem through different tokens but also implements Web3 community governance for more democratic and decentralized platform operations. Additionally, Pido introduces unique Creator Influence Tokens (PMT) as a medium linking creators and consumers, reflecting the creator's market value and personal influence, providing consumers with certain economic participation opportunities.

These comprehensive solutions collectively build an innovative and sustainable platform, bringing new possibilities and opportunities to the Web3 creation market.
