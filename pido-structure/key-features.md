# Key Features

## Decentralization and Proof of Ownership

In a decentralized environment, Pido eliminates the need for intermediaries through blockchain technology, allowing transactions to take place directly between buyers and sellers. This not only increases efficiency but also reduces costs. Proof of ownership is realized in the form of NFTs, each of which is unique and contains all important information about the creation, including the creator, owner, and the creations' history. Pido ensures that every transaction is permanently recorded on the blockchain, providing immutable evidence of the creation's authenticity and ownership.

## Tokenization of Affordable Creations

The tokenization of affordable creations is the process of converting physical creation into digital assets. On Pido, affordable creations are digitized by being created into NFTs, which involves photographing the original creation, describing, authenticating, and storing this information on the blockchain. This allows the affordable creation to be easily traded globally without the need for physical transportation, while also ensuring the uniqueness and traceability of the affordable creation.

## Smart Contract-Driven Transactions

Smart contracts are programs that automatically execute, control, and confirm transactions. When the parties to a transaction reach an agreement, the smart contract automatically processes the payment and the transfer of ownership of the creation, ensuring the transaction is quick and secure. Smart contracts can also be programmed to handle more complex tasks, such as dividends, royalty payments, and contract renewalsâ€”services that traditional exchanges cannot provide.

## Token Mechanisms

Pido has introduced a series of innovative token mechanisms aimed at maintaining and enhancing the stability of the entire system and its capacity for ongoing operation. We have designed a variety of token acquisition pathways, including but not limited to "Transact to Earn", "Bid to Earn" and some very radical mechanism such as Harberger Tax. Such design not only effectively incentivizes users to actively participate in all aspects of the platform but also injects continuous innovation momentum and development potential into the platform.

We firmly believe that this decentralized token mechanism will bring sustained vitality and expansion to Pido. It not only increases user engagement and loyalty but also stimulates creative thinking and value creation through a token economy. Ultimately, this will create a virtuous cycle where the growth and participation of users directly feed back into the development of the platform, creating a win-win situation for all participants.

## Community Participation and Governance

Pido will provide a governance framework that allows token holders to vote on key decisions about the platform. This may include the introduction of new features, changes in fee structures, or modifications to platform rules. Holders of governance tokens thus have a say in the development of the platform, and their voting rights are proportional to the number of tokens they hold.

## Creation Auctions and Crowdfunding

Pido can support creation auctions, including timed and live auctions. Designers/Artists can sell their original works through auctions, while the secondary market allows collectors to trade these creations amongst themselves. This facilitates the circulation of creation and provides collectors with potential capital appreciation opportunities.

Pido's crowdfunding platform enables designers/artists to obtain funding support directly from the public. Designers/Artists can showcase their project ideas and set funding goals and deadlines. Holders who participate in the auction and successfully bid on limited edition works will have the opportunity to receive a certain percentage of revenue from subsequent crowdfunding sales. Supporters can contribute funds in exchange for early access to the creation, special recognition, or other rewards. Crowdfunding not only provides designers/artists with an opportunity to realize creative projects but also allows supporters to participate directly in the creation creation process.

## Regular Dividends

Pido is dedicated to ensuring that all holders of PIT can fully experience the tangible benefits of owning Pido rights. This philosophy reflects not only our commitment to promoting and maintaining decentralized principles but is also aimed at incentivizing our users to hold PIT for the long term and grow together with the platform. To achieve this goal, we have adopted an incentive measure: regular dividends.

We promise to convert 60% of Pido's net fiat profit into USDT and distribute it as dividends to users who stake PIT on the platform at the end of each quarter. This action is not only a reward for user loyalty but also a part of the exploration of the DAO governance model. We hope to encourage users to participate in the platform's economic activities and collectively decide the future development direction of the platform through this method.
