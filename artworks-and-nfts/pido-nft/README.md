# Pido NFT

NFTs constitute the cornerstone of the digital assets on Pido, playing a crucial role. Utilizing advanced cryptographic technology, we can ensure the uniqueness and indisputable ownership of each piece of design/art. At the same time, by embedding NFC (Near Field Communication) chips into the designs/artworks, we have achieved a seamless integration between the physical deisng/artwork and its corresponding NFT. This unique binding mechanism not only enhances the security of the design/artwork but also greatly facilitates the transfer and verification of ownership.&#x20;

Pido NFTs are not just digital certificates for designs/artworks; they are also key to enabling a variety of asset functionalities. These functions include but are not limited to proving the authenticity of the design/artwork, tracking the provenance and ownership history, simplifying and securing the buying and selling process of designs/artworks, and creating and sustaining an active secondary market for design/art. With NFTs, buyers and sellers of design/artwork can transact in a transparent and secure environment, ensuring that designers/artists receive the recognition and remuneration they deserve for their creations.
