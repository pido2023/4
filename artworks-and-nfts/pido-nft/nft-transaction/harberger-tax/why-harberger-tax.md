# Why Harberger Tax?

The Harberger Tax was proposed by economist Arnold Harberger as a model of taxation. The core idea is that asset holders must declare the value of their assets themselves and pay taxes based on this declared value. At the same time, the asset holders must be willing to accept a purchase offer from anyone willing to buy the asset at the self-assessed value. This mechanism is designed to encourage asset holders to assess the value of their assets honestly, to avoid paying high taxes, while also not risking the loss of their assets at a price below the market value.

## **Enhancement of Investment Efficiency**

Investment efficiency refers to the ability of asset holders to increase the value of their assets through investment activities. Traditional models of asset investment—whether in conventional markets or on blockchain platforms—typically rely on asset returns or appreciation to attract investors to hold for the long term, aiming for higher returns. However, this model may weaken the liquidity of assets and currency, thereby reducing market efficiency.

The Harberger Tax model promotes asset liquidity by instituting a compulsory sale mechanism, reducing the incentive for asset hoarding. This model protects the interests of the seller through an English auction method, ensuring that the asset value is not compromised. Overall, the Harberger Tax can reduce asset hoarding, increase liquidity and price transparency, thus enhancing market efficiency. The implementation of this tax system will promote a more efficient and fair distribution of assets.

## **Increase in Allocation Efficiency**

Allocation efficiency refers to the degree of distribution of property among the various contributors in the system. Traditional asset allocation may lead to unnecessary losses in net economic efficiency due to improper resource allocation (such as pricing too high or too low). Particularly in terms of property ownership, excessively high prices can lead to transaction failures, missing out on potential buyers who might use the asset more efficiently at a lower price.

By lowering prices to increase the volume of transactions, the Harberger Tax system can improve economic efficiency and reduce unnecessary losses.

## **Transaction Mechanism Under the Harberger Tax System**

Under the Harberger Tax model, asset owners typically quote a price higher than their minimum acceptable price, in line with the seller's interests; while buyers bid lower than their maximum willing price, in line with the buyer's interests. Due to the bargaining strategies of both parties, the pricing mechanism may lead to inefficient asset transfers or unnecessary losses.

* When sellers quote, to prevent overpricing, they need to pay tax on their quoted price
* When buyers bid, to prevent underbidding, an ascending auction mechanism should be used to prevent winning the asset at a low price.&#x20;

Under the Harberger Tax system, asset owners cannot set too high a price, which would result in a high tax burden. The ascending auction mechanism ensures that sellers can set a lower starting price, but buyers who directly match this price might lose the opportunity to acquire the asset due to subsequent bidding. This market mechanism transfers the property distribution rights to all system participants.

Although the Harberger Tax may reduce investment efficiency, it can significantly enhance allocation efficiency, building a moderate system of asset commoning.

## **Implementation and Impact of the Harberger Tax on the Blockchain**

In the era before digitalization and information technology had matured, the implementation of the Harberger Tax was limited by its operational complexity and lower tax rate effects, resulting in relatively limited economic welfare benefits, and its potential growth effects often only became apparent over several years. However, with the rapid progress of modern information technology and the gradual perfection of blockchain technology, the application of the Harberger Tax has become more feasible and convenient.

Blockchain technology lays the foundation for economic experiments within closed environments, particularly in the application of anonymized asset management, ensuring the security and privacy of transactions through distributed ledger technology. This is particularly evident in the ever-expanding market for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), where blockchain technology provides strong support for the secure and efficient trading of NFTs.

The implementation of the Harberger Tax system on the blockchain has created an innovative transaction mechanism that allows for trading in an environment without the need for trust, while ensuring asset liquidity and market transparency. Under this mechanism, any participant can initiate a bid for assets (such as NFTs), regardless of whether the asset owner has the intention to sell. Thus, sellers can understand the market value of their assets in real-time, while buyers can complete transactions with greater confidence under transparent market pricing.
