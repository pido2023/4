# Harberger Tax

Harberger tax, as an innovative initiative of Pido in the field of crypto-economics, is not only an important attempt and in-depth exploration of the existing crypto asset management model, but it also represents our commitment and determination to promote the development of the entire industry.&#x20;

We designed this tax mechanism based on a core concept: to promote the efficient circulation of crypto assets through reasonable tax incentives, thereby enhancing the vitality and transparency of the entire market. The introduction of Harberger tax aims to address the common problem of asset hoarding in traditional markets, by levying a tax based on the current market value of the assets on holders, encouraging them to continually reassess the true value of their holdings. With this approach, we hope to reduce excessive speculative behavior and encourage assets to flow more frequently into the hands of investors who truly appreciate their value, thereby providing better liquidity for crypto assets.&#x20;

The Harberger tax is our brave attempt at the possible avenues for crypto asset tax policy. We hope this can provide practical data and experience for future policymakers and economists, to jointly promote the healthy and sustainable development of the crypto economy.
