# Vision & Concept

The Harberger Tax constitutes an economic instrument designed to mediate between the extremes of pure private ownership and absolute public control, promoting a more equitable distribution within the system. This fiscal approach aims to enhance the efficiency of property utilization within an economy, curtailing the prevalence of suboptimal allocation practices while preserving the dynamism of a free market environment.

Implementation of the Harberger Tax initiates a moderate redistribution of assets among participants, fostering a more equitable wealth distribution. This is achieved at the relative cost of investment returns, thereby mitigating wealth disparity and curtailing the monopolistic accumulation of wealth through asset hoarding.

By adopting the Harberger Tax mechanism, there is an opportunity to reconcile the rights associated with personal property ownership with the equitable distribution of resources, thus engendering a more equitable and sustainable economic framework.

## Harberger Tax Concept

* **Self-Assessment and Tax Rate:** Property owners declare the value of their assets and pay a percentage of that value as tax over regular intervals. The tax rate must be carefully set; too high, and it becomes punitive, too low, and it fails to incentivize the efficient allocation of assets.
* **Enforced Sale Mechanism:** To prevent owners from undervaluing their assets to pay less tax, the mechanism enforces that any property is always for sale at the self-assessed price. This creates a constant "open market" situation for all assets under the system.
