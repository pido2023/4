# Curation

Curation transaction model is designed to incentivize various stakeholders within the NFT ecosystem, where designers/artists are rewarded with direct payments and fees from curators and curators are incentivized through commissions and PIT rewards to facilitate sales.

## **Financial Distribution**

### **For auctioned non-limited NFTs**

* The designer/artist receives 93% of the transaction amount.
* Pido takes a 5% fee.
* The curator receives a 2% commission for facilitating the sale.

### **For crowdfunded limited NFTs**

* The designer/artist receives 6% of the transaction amount.
* Pido takes a combined 7% for fees and management
* The OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) factor gets 85% of the transaction amount to cover costs.&#x20;
* The curator receives a 2% commission for facilitating the sale.

## **Token Dynamics**

### **PIC Tokens**

Curators must pay a monthly PIC fee for all NFTs they list. This fee is then given to the designers/artists, which creates a direct revenue stream for the creators of the NFTs.

### **PIT Tokens**

* When an NFT is purchased or auctioned through the curation system, the curator receives 95% of the PIT rewards generated by the system.&#x20;
* Pido receives 2% of the PIT rewards.
* 3% of the PIT rewards are burned.
