# NFT Status

Pido wishes to create a self-regulating market where assets are priced fairly based on their actual utility to their owners and therefore introduces an innovative mechanism of NFT status. Here is a detailed explanation.

## **Locked State**

* **Acquisition:** When users acquire an NFT through auction, crowdfunding, or secondary market transactions, it is initially in a locked state.
* **Mandatory Holding Period:** This state enforces a mandatory holding period, typically for security or governance reasons, ensuring that users can't immediately resell the NFT. The minimum duration is one day.
* **Unlocking:** Users have the option to unlock their NFTs. Unlocking is necessary to prepare the NFT for resale.

## **Activated State**

* **Transition to Activation:** Once the locked state period has ended, users can activate their NFTs for free, which allows them to engage with the platform's marketplace.
* **Pricing and Taxation:** Activated NFTs must be assigned a price by the owner, which is crucial for the Harberger Tax mechanism.
  * **Harberger Tax:** This is a self-assessed taxation system where the owner sets the price of their NFT and pays a tax based on this price. The tax incentivizes realistic pricing and liquidity, as overpricing leads to higher taxes, while underpricing risks losing the asset to a willing buyer.
  * **PIT Pricing:** NFTs can only be priced in PIT for both non-limited edition and limited edition.&#x20;

* **Staking for Listing:** To list an NFT on the secondary market, the owner must stake 4.68% of the NFT's price in PIT. This acts as a form of a sincerity deposit.
* **Secondary Market:** Once activated, NFTs are automatically listed for sale on the secondary market. The market facilitates buying and selling between users, with the following considerations:
  * **Rewards:** Successful transactions will yield rewards from the system, encouraging active participation in the platform's economy.

* **Locking Fee:** When a user wishes to change the state of an Activated NFT back to Locked, they must pay a fee. Check the details in:

[harberger-tax](harberger-tax/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

* **User Flexibility:** Owners have the flexibility to toggle between locked and activated states, giving them control over their assets' market presence.

This double-state NFT mechanism is designed to create a balanced and active NFT market. The Locked state provides security and stability, while the Activated state encourages fair pricing and liquidity. The Harberger Tax introduces a novel approach to asset valuation that balances owner utility against market efficiency. The staking requirement adds a layer of sincerity to the market, ensuring that NFTs are not listed frivolously. The entire system is underpinned by the PIT token, which not only serves as the currency for transactions and tax payments but also as a reward to incentivize market participation.
