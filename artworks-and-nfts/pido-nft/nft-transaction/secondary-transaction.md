# Secondary Transaction

## **Participants**

Secondary market transactions engage two primary entities

* Current asset holders (sellers)&#x20;
* Prospective acquirer (buyers)

## **Transaction Mechanisms**

1. Transactions involving non-limited edition NFTs
   * These NFTs are available for direct purchase, with settlement permissible in only PIT tokens.
   * The transaction is deemed complete once the buyer executes the payment.
2. Transactions involving limited edition NFTs
   * Auctions are the mode of sale for limited edition NFTs.
   * An auction is initiated when an individual agrees to the seller's initial price, triggering a 24-hour duration for the submission of subsequent higher bids.
   * Subsequent bids result in a 24-hour extension of the auction, a process which can repeat indefinitely.
   * Absence of higher bids within a 24-hour timeframe concludes the auction, resulting in the sale of the NFT to the highest bidder.
   * The anti-sniping feature where each new bid extends the auction duration will ensure all interested parties have the opportunity to participate.

## **Financial Distribution**

1. Revenue from transactions of non-limited edition NFTs
   * Designers/Artists are compensated with 2% of the transaction value in PIT tokens.
   * Sellers obtain 95% of the transaction value.
   * A service charge of 3% is levied by Pido.
2. Revenue from transactions of limited edition NFTs
   * Designers/Artists are awarded 2% of the concluding transaction amount.
   * Sellers determine a foundational price of $$Q_0$$ in PIT tokens.
   * The ultimate purchase price is established at $$Q_f$$ in PIT tokens.
   * Bidders incrementally increase the price, each submitting a bid of $$Q_i$$ PIT tokens, where $$i$$ indexes the bid.
   * The increment above the starting price is denoted as $$\Delta Q_i=Q_i-Q_0$$.
   * Bidders collectively receive a share of the concluding transaction amount, calculated as $$95\%(\frac {Q_f-Q_0}{Qf})^{r_{14}}$$, where $$r_{14}>1$$.
   * Individual bidder earnings are calculated as $$95\%\frac {\Delta Q_i}{\sum \Delta Q_i}(\frac {Q_f-Q_0}{Qf})^{r_{14}}$$.
   * Sellers gain the remaining of 95% of the final transaction value, calculated as $$95\%[1-(\frac {Q_f-Q_0}{Qf})^{r_{14}}]$$.
   * A service charge of 3% is levied by Pido.
   * This is a mechanism that encourages bidding and drive up sale prices.

## **Token Dynamics**

### **PIC Tokens**

* A security staking in PIT tokens, no less than 4.68% of the initial NFT price $$4.68\%Q_0$$ PIT, is mandatory for sellers in transactions settled with PIT tokens to list the NFTs, for both limited and non-limited NFTs.
* This security staking is subject to a regular Harberger tax, with the residual amount accruing PIC benefits.
* Check the staking details in

### **PIT Tokens**

* A monthly Harberger tax is imposed on sellers, calculated in PIT tokens.
* Successful transactions for both limited and non-limited NFTs yield a collective receipt of 95% of the PIT tokens generated by the system to both parties.
* The apportionment of PIT tokens between the involved parties is contingent upon the purchase timing.
* A token burn mechanism is activated with each successful transaction, annihilating 3% of the PIT tokens generated by the system.
