# Background

In the NFT trading sphere, there are two main models, both of which are derived from the lending frameworks of De-Fi.

The peer-to-peer model, as represented by NFT-Fi, requires the borrowing and lending parties to directly connect and negotiate to determine the loan amount, fixed interest rate, and loan maturity date. The advantage of this model is that it does not rely on price oracles to set the value of NFTs, thus reducing dependency on external information sources. It offers a higher capital utilization efficiency to borrowers but also introduces transaction friction, particularly due to the restrictions brought by fixed maturity dates. For lenders, this model can result in poor capital utilization efficiency, as they must wait to match with suitable borrowers.

The peer-to-pool model absorbs the concept of liquidity pools from DeFi. In this model, lenders' funds are aggregated into a shared pool, and the interest rate for loans is determined by the utilization rate of funds, theoretically improving capital utilization efficiency. However, this model usually employs a more conservative Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, assessing the floor price of the NFT series. This means that for blue-chip NFT holders, despite theoretically higher capital utilization efficiency, they may actually be able to borrow less due to conservative LTV settings.

Pido has innovated the peer-to-pool trading model by integrating the fundamental principles of De-Fi to enhance its functionality.&#x20;

By adopting the Harberger Tax system, Pido has implemented an internal asset pricing mechanism, which is independent of the traditional external price oracles, enhancing the protocol's intrinsic consistency and security. Simultaneously, Pido has meticulously optimized the assessment system for the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, allowing borrowers to use capital more efficiently.&#x20;

Pido has increased the capital efficiency for lenders, allowing their funds to provide staking weight for the platform while also serving as providers of lending liquidity. This innovation not only achieves the unified use of transaction and lending funds but also strengthens the liquidity of the entire platform's funds.&#x20;

Pido utilizes its native utility token PIC as the means of interest payment, which not only alleviates the repayment burden for borrowers but also incentivizes user engagement and activity on the platform.
