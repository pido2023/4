# RWA & Digital-Physical Designs/Artworks

## RWA

Blockchain technology provides an innovative pathway for the digitization and tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). The application of this technology has had a significant impact on traditional asset management and investment fields.

* **Asset Digitization**: Transforming the rights to a physical asset into a digital form, often accompanied by the creation of digital certificates or tokens that represent these assets.
* **Tokenization**: Dividing the ownership or partial interests of an asset into tokens that can be issued and traded on the blockchain. These tokens can be either security tokens or utility tokens, depending on their use case and legal framework.
* **Increased Liquidity**: Tokenization can divide traditionally illiquid assets into smaller units, making it possible for more investors to buy and sell these assets, thus increasing market liquidity.
* **Rapid Settlement**: The automation and decentralized nature of blockchain allow for near-instantaneous settlement of asset trades, reducing the time and complexity needed for traditional financial settlements.
* **Decentralized Verification**: Data on the blockchain is transparent and immutable, meaning that anyone can verify asset ownership without relying on intermediary institutions such as banks or law firms.

## Digital-Physical Products

The vast majority of on-chain activities, such as NFT minting and trading, remain confined to the digital environment, while the integration of crypto-native digital items with their physical forms, through the use of NFC (Near Field Communication) and blockchain technology, indeed opens up new horizons, extending the concept of digital assets into the physical world. The application of this technology deepens consumer-brand interactions and adds new layers of value to physical products.&#x20;

### 1. Bridging the Physical and Digital Worlds

* **Proximity Interactions**: NFC chips can be easily read by devices such as smartphones, allowing for the verification of the authenticity of physical items and triggering on-chain actions, such as minting NFTs or recording activities.
* **Location-Sensitive Utilities**: Physical items can unlock specific digital content or services, such as automatically minting commemorative NFTs when entering a landmark, or offering digital rewards during certain events.

### 2. Enhanced Consumer Goods

* **Agency and Reputation**: Goods gain an on-chain identity via NFC chips, which can record their history, ownership transfers, and consumer interactions, building brand trust and product authenticity.
* **Value Retention at Resale**: The transparency and immutability of these records mean that the history and value of goods can be traded on secondary markets without being lost due to changes in ownership.

### 3. New Distribution Channels

* **Dynamic Utility**: Creators and brands can design product utilities that change over time, such as unlocking new digital rewards as the frequency of product use increases.
* **Community Engagement**: Tracking interactions between physical products and community members can encourage and reward contributors to the community.

### 4. Unlocking Full-Stack Utilities

* **Dual Value in Physical and Digital**: Products offer utility not just in the physical world but can also provide additional entitlements in the digital realm, such as access to specific digital content or communities.
* **Enhanced Ownership Experience**: Consumers can engage more deeply with brands through the product's on-chain history, enjoying unique experiences and value that the product brings.

This trend towards digital-physical products may foster new consumption patterns where products are not just passive objects of purchase but become platforms for interactive experiences and value creation. With the maturation of technology and increasing consumer acceptance, we can anticipate the emergence of a more interactive, dynamic, and personalized consumption environment.

## Digital-Physical Artworks/Designs & Pido

Pido designed an advanced system where physical artworks/designs are connected to the blockchain through NFC technology, creating a digital twin in the form of NFTs. We see the immense potential to bring on-chain interactions into the real world and believe that the digital-physical infrastructure will soon bring new utilities to various physical artworks/designs.

Pido achieves a close coupling between physical artworks/designs and their on-chain records and ownership through the integration of embedded chips with on-chain programmability, making the physical and digital a unified product. We've enabled a wallet-like functionality for physical artworks/designs, such as token-controlled access, signing, and asset ownership, thus unlocking unprecedented end-consumer experiences. This technology not only allows consumers to prove their contact with the artwork/designs or presence in a physical space through proximity scanning hardware but also provides art/design holders with eligibility for future rewards.

By endowing any consumer good with agency and reputation, chips with signature generation capabilities make any item capable of establishing its own on-chain history, allowing owners to accumulate value in their interactions with brands and communities. Even when items change hands, their on-chain records detach from the owners, maintaining the integrity of history, and can be priced accordingly.

Pido has created a new distribution channel for artists/designers to provide ongoing, dynamic utility for their products and spaces. Interaction becomes a metric used to offer different rewards to the most active members, which, in turn, motivates greater participation in the community.

Pido is going to push the boundaries of how physical items are interfaced with the digital world, potentially transforming how we think about ownership, community, and the lifecycle of products.
