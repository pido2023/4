# Token Mechanism

Pido has adopted a more innovative token mechanism to ensure the stability of the system and its long-term operation. By diversifying the ways in which tokens are produced, we encourage more users to actively participate in the community, bringing more innovation and development to the platform. This token mechanism not only increases the activity of the community but also enhances interaction and communication among users. Users can participate in different activities such as voting and community events by holding tokens, thereby earning more rewards. We believe that this decentralized token mechanism will promote the development and growth of Pido, benefiting more users.

## Triple-Token Model (PIC, PIT, PMT)&#x20;

* **PIC**: Utility token used to measure the circulating value within the system.&#x20;
* **PIT**: Governance token, which embodies the governance value, related to voting rights and platform decision-making.&#x20;
* **PMT**: Influence token, used to measure the value of an designer/artist's influence.

## Token Offering and Decay Mechanism&#x20;

Pido has implemented a dynamic token production mechanism related to the remaining total supply of tokens. As the remaining amount of tokens reduces, the speed of new token production also decays accordingly. This design is intended to prevent the rapid depletion of the token pool, ensuring the stability and sustainability of the token supply over the long term. This soft-production approach helps to prevent inflation in the market while maintaining the scarcity and value of the tokens.

## Reward and Relationship with Holding Quantity&#x20;

To further ensure the fairness of the economic model, Pido has adopted an incentive measure where the speed of token production for a user is adjusted based on the number of tokens they hold. The more tokens held, the slower the speed at which new tokens are acquired by the individual, helping to reduce wealth concentration and mitigate the Matthew effect. Conversely, when users stake (lock) their tokens, their token production speed will increase, encouraging long-term investment and participation in community governance, while also increasing the locked volume of tokens, reducing market circulation supply, and supporting token price stability.

## Token Burning and Issuance Mechanism&#x20;

To prevent deflation, Pido has introduced an issuance mechanism based on token burning. In this mechanism, certain specific activities (such as transaction fees, service fees, etc.) will involve the burning of tokens, which means permanently removing a certain number of tokens from circulation. Burning tokens reduces the total amount in circulation, while the platform will issue new tokens according to preset rules, to ensure the stability of the overall supply. This mechanism is designed to balance the supply of tokens and avoid a death spiral effect due to excessive scarcity of tokens.

## Harberger Tax for Secondary Market Transactions&#x20;

Pido employs a Harberger Tax mechanism to manage secondary market transactions. Harberger Tax is a self-regulating tax mechanism that taxes transactions inversely to the holding time. This means that the shorter the time a user holds tokens, the higher the tax rate they pay when trading. This mechanism encourages holders to keep their assets for longer periods, while providing liquidity for those who trade frequently, albeit at a higher cost. This tax strategy aims to increase the liquidity of assets in the system while curbing speculative behavior.

## Successful Auction Usersâ€™ Rights and Crowdfunding Profit Sharing

Each user who successfully acquires a limited edition NFT through the auction channel is not only seen as a collector but is also endowed with the status of an investor behind the design piece. When these limited edition design pieces enter the crowdfunding stage, successfully raise the required funds, and are ultimately put into production, not only will the original designers gain their deserved profits, but all investors holding the related design NFTs will also enjoy the right to share in the dividends. The profit sharing will be distributed based on the number of NFTs held and a predetermined proportion of the final profits of the crowdfunding project. The implementation of this mechanism not only attracts more users to invest in limited edition designs but also provides an innovative solution for facilitating the value transformation between digital art and physical goods.

## Quadratic Funding for Auctions and Crowdfunding&#x20;

Pido has adopted the quadratic funding model for primary market auctions and crowdfunding activities. In this mechanism, the relationship between a user's contribution to a project and the amount they pay is quadratic, not linear. This means that small contributors can enjoy a higher marginal impact, while large contributors have a lower marginal impact. This design encourages broad participation, as even small contributions can have a significant effect. Through this method, Pido can better mobilize the enthusiasm of each member within the community, achieving a fairer distribution of resources and fundraising for projects. The quadratic voting and crowdfunding mechanism promote cooperation among community members rather than competition, thereby advancing the common interests of the entire community.

## NFT Lending and Interest Payment Mechanism Under Harberger Tax System

Users can collateralize their NFTs using a pricing model based on the Harberger tax system for lending purposes. In lending transactions, borrowers are required to pay loan interest using PIC tokens, which enhances the liquidity and utility of the PIC tokens. Meanwhile, the interest is directly converted into PIT token staking rewards and distributed to users who participate in governance staking on the platform. Through this mechanism, holders of PIC tokens can not only earn returns through loan interest but can also engage in platform governance by staking PIT tokens, gaining potential income. The introduction of this complex financial mechanism incentivizes users to participate more actively in the platform's economic activities, whether as NFT holders or governance participants. It not only increases the liquidity of NFTs and reduces the idleness of capital but also provides users with diversified sources of income.

In summary, Pido's multi-token economic system and community governance design aim to create a self-regulating, dynamically balanced ecosystem containing complex mechanisms designed to maintain token value, incentivize user participation, and ensure the long-term healthy development of the community. Through the interaction of these mechanisms, Pido seeks to achieve a platform that can both incentivize individual investment and support, and ensure the overall prosperity and stability of the community.
