# Token Standard

Pido has opted for the ERC-3525 standard as the foundation for several of its key offerings, including its auction-based limited edition NFTs, its crowdfunding-based unlimited edition NFTs, and its designer/artist influence certificates known as PMTs. The rationale behind the selection of the ERC-3525 standard is multifaceted and encompasses the following points:

1. **Interoperability and Versatile Application**: ERC-3525 stands as a keystone standard that enables a high degree of interoperability across various blockchain platforms and systems. This standard is particularly conducive to a wide array of applications, most notably in the tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWAs). By leveraging ERC-3525, Pido can create a seamless narrative for tokenizing physical assets, opening up avenues for integrating tangible asset investments into the digital ecosystem.
2. **NFT Variant Management**: The unique nature of NFTs on the Pido platform can result in a complex landscape where multiple versions of a design/artwork (with the same ID) or entirely different designs/artworks (with different IDs) need to be managed effectively. ERC-3525's standard allows for this level of complexity by providing a structured yet flexible framework that can handle the nuances of NFT versions and editions. This adaptability is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the NFT metadata and ensuring that each token remains distinct and identifiable.
3. **Granular Membership Tracking**: PMT, serving as a testament to designer/artist influence, is adeptly suited to the ERC-3525 standard. This standard allows for the creation of slots to represent different levels or categories of membership and the use of IDs to track individual user activities. With ERC-3525, Pido can issue designer/artist influence certificates that not only confer benefits or access within the platform but also enable detailed tracking of holder engagement and contributions. This granularity ensures that holders' rights and privileges are transparently and accurately managed, enhancing the value of the PMT certificates.
4. **Slot and ID Functionality**: ERC-3525 introduces a novel approach to NFTs by allowing each token to contain slots, which can be seen as sub-categories or attributes within the token itself. These slots can hold values that represent different characteristics or entitlements. Furthermore, the standard allows for the assignment of unique IDs to each token, facilitating individualized tracking and management. In the context of Pido, this means that a single NFT can represent a complex asset with multiple facets, such as a piece of design/artwork that includes rights to both the physical painting and digital reproductions.
5. **Enhanced Liquidity and Fractional Ownership**: ERC-3525 enables partial ownership due to its inherent design, which allows tokens to be split or combined without losing track of their underlying value. This feature is particularly beneficial for crowdfunding scenarios, where multiple stakeholders may own fractions of an NFT, and for auction-based NFTs, where the value of the asset can be distributed across various investors. In turn, this can enhance the liquidity of these digital assets, making them more accessible and attractive to a broader investor base.
6. **Upgradability and Future-Proofing**: By adopting a standard like ERC-3525, Pido positions itself at the forefront of blockchain innovation. This standard is designed to be forward-compatible, meaning that as the blockchain space evolves and new features or practices emerge, the ERC-3525 standard and the tokens issued under it can be updated to incorporate these advancements. This ensures that Pido's tokens remain relevant and functional, providing long-term value to holders.

In summary, the decision to utilize the ERC-3525 standard reflects Pido's commitment to building a robust, flexible, and future-proof platform that can cater to a diverse range of digital assets and user needs. It acknowledges the growing demand for sophisticated tokenization strategies that can bridge the gap between the virtual and the physical, providing a comprehensive solution for the next generation of blockchain applications.
