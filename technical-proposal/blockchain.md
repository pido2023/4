Blockchain technology and Layer 2 (L2) solutions have become key tools for enhancing transaction efficiency and reducing costs. Here are several reasons why Pido has chosen Arbitrum as its public chain solution:

1. **Low Gas Fees**: According to the latest data from [L2Fees.info](https://l2fees.info/), Arbitrum offers very competitive gas fees. For instance, the cost to send ETH is just $0.12, compared to $1.15 on Ethereum Layer-1, demonstrating Arbitrum's clear advantage in cost efficiency.
2. **Compatibility and Interoperability**: Arbitrum is an EVM-compatible L2 solution, allowing developers and users to run EVM-compatible smart contracts and DApps on its platform. This seamless migration and compatibility significantly reduce the barriers to switching to L2.
3. **Scalability and High Throughput**: Arbitrum uses Optimistic Rollup technology, which increases scalability and transaction throughput by batching transactions and verifying them off-chain. This provides a solution for dealing with Ethereum network congestion and high transaction fees.
4. **Security and Decentralization**: Arbitrum leverages the security of the Ethereum mainnet to protect transactions and assets on its L2. Its Optimistic Rollup design improves efficiency and scalability without sacrificing security, which is crucial for developers and users who want to use L2 solutions safely.
5. **Developer Ecosystem and Tool Support**: Arbitrum has an active developer community and extensive tool support, offering rich resources and documentation for developers to better build and deploy applications.
6. **Rapidly Developing Ecosystem and High Market Share**: Arbitrum not only dominates the Layer 2 solution space, according to data from [L2beat.com](https://l2beat.com/), it has a market share of over 65.58% in the L2 market with more than 200 ecosystem projects, and it is showing an organic growth trend.

These factors together prove Arbitrum's strength as an L2 solution and its attractiveness to Pido.
