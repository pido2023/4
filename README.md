# What is Pido?

**Pido** stands as a pioneering Web 3.0-based platform for affordable creations.&#x20;

## Characteristics

* **Meta-Assets:** Each upload by designers/artists is linked to a unique physical object, secured on the blockchain. This forms meta-assets, ensuring work security, traceability, and elevates their collectible and investment value.&#x20;
* **Auctions and Crowdfunding:** We determine varied production and sales methods through auctions and crowdfunding. Consumers access physical creations and corresponding NFTs.
* **Fair Recommendation Index:** Our platform establishes a transparent recommendation index through diverse purchase methods, including fiat currency and token transactions.&#x20;
* **"Buyers" or "Curators":** Introducing a distinctive role, they obtain non-physical NFTs using platform tokens. By showcasing these products and driving sales, they earn additional tokens and fiat currency commissions.&#x20;
* **Multi-Token Model and High-Liquidity Market:** Featuring a flexible multi-token model, varied mining mechanisms, and a high-liquidity public property secondary market based on the Harberger tax.&#x20;

These innovations tackle prevailing issues within the designer/artist brand market while introducing a novel business model. Our system benefits diverse users—designers, artists, merchants, consumers, and Web 3.0 investors—ushering in a new era of collaboration and growth.
