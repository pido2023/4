# Decentralized Recommendation

In traditional personalized recommendation systems, user behavior data such as browsing and liking are collected to build profiles of user preferences. These data are analyzed using complex mathematical models to predict user likes and recommend content to users through a centralized mechanism. However, this method has issues such as low user behavior cost, which can lead to malicious recommendation gaming or overly mundane recommendations.

In our innovative decentralized recommendation mechanism, users' recommendation actions have a costâ€”not just monetarily, with PIC tokens used for voting, but also behaviorally, by using votes to express endorsement of content. The design of this mechanism is to ensure that users are more cautious and purposeful when making recommendations. The PIC tokens paid by users to vote are destroyed, which not only reduces the number of tokens in circulation, thereby increasing the scarcity of the tokens, but also prevents meaningless ballot stuffing by raising the marginal cost.

Our decentralized recommendation mechanism incentivizes users with PIT token rewards. The number of effective votes a user has is determined by the number of voting tokens and the number of PIT tokens they hold, and is calculated using a power function with an exponent less than 1. This design not only encourages user participation but also improves the quality of recommendations. Since the platform is not only a place for content consumption but also a marketplace for goods trading, the priority and visibility of recommendations are directly linked to potential sales. This design means that earlier recommendations can achieve higher exposure, so users are more motivated to discover and recommend high-quality goods.

Although our recommendation system may not perfectly align with all users' personal preferences, users can still find products of interest through the search function. We use AI algorithms combined with users' past recommendation actions and search history to provide personalized product recommendations. This approach not only gives users the freedom to explore and discover new content but also enhances the diversity and personalization of the recommendation system, thereby promoting the rich and healthy development of the platform ecosystem. Through this mechanism, we encourage users to be active participants in the ecosystem building, driving community-based content and product recommendations, making the results fairer, more valuable, and supported by community consensus.
