# Pido Index

Pido Index is an index specifically designed for products and users, evaluating the overall performance of a product by comprehensively considering multiple key performance indicators. Pido Index is only comparable among products or users under the same mode. Different sales modes, such as auctions & crowdfunding or artist & curator,  have unique dynamics and behaviors, making their Pido Indices incomparable horizontally.&#x20;

In Pido, the performance is not measured simply by a single indicator or an average, but through a mathematical modeling approach that considers the relative importance of different indicators. Pido assigns a specific weight to each indicator, based on its anticipated contribution to the success of the product. The determination of weights is achieved through carefully designed nonlinear functions, meaning that the gains of some indicators may decrease or increase with their numerical growth, reflecting the market's nonlinear response to certain performances.&#x20;

Pido Index may change over different periods, which may be caused by changes in market trends, shifts in consumer preferences, updates, and iterations of the product itself, among others. Both platforms and users can use this data to analyze the trend of performance over time, thus making more precise market positioning and promotional strategy adjustments. The dynamic changes of Pido Index provide a tool for platforms to recommend products or users based on the index's performance at different times, optimize the timing of item displays, and target user groups, in order to maximize sales effectiveness and customer satisfaction.
