# Activities and Airdrops

Pido is dedicated to creating an active and highly engaging community environment. To achieve this goal, Pido will regularly organize a variety of community events aimed at encouraging interaction and participation among community members. Participating in events not only strengthens the connections between community members but also allows participants to gain a deeper understanding of Pido's products and vision. More importantly, to reward actively participating community members, Pido will provide PIT tokens through airdrops to participants.

Pido believes that such incentive mechanisms can further enhance community cohesion, drive the platform's growth, and bring tangible benefits to community members. As the community grows, Pido also expects to introduce more innovative events and incentive measures to continue attracting and maintaining a high level of user activity.
