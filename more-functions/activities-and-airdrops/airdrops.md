# Airdrops

## Designer/Artist Airdrop

We will implement a special incentive measure — the Designer/Artist Airdrop Program — to attract and reward outstanding designers/artists. Here are the PIT airdrop details tailored for our designers/artists.

* **Initial Airdrop Incentive**: As a reward for designers/artists who settle in early, we will provide an airdrop of PIT tokens.
* **Performance-Based Airdrop Rewards**: Designers/Artists will receive a corresponding PIT airdrop budget based on the sales performance of their works — including sales revenue, volume, and market popularity.
* **Graduated Airdrop Distribution**: Designers/Artists are required to distribute PIT airdrops to users holding their PMT. The amount of airdrop received by users will be weighted according to the level of PMT they hold, with higher levels receiving a larger share of the airdrop.

## Other Community Activity Airdrops

The Pidothon community will not only reward designers/artists but also incentivize our user base through a variety of activities. Here are the main guidelines for community activity airdrops.

* **Activity Airdrop Rewards**: Users who participate and meet the requirements of specific community activities will have the opportunity to receive PIT airdrops distributed by the system.
* **Engagement Airdrop Incentives**: We will periodically assess user engagement, individual weight, and activity participation to distribute PIT airdrops accordingly.
* **Clarity of Activity Rules**: The specific rules for airdrops for each activity will be determined according to the content of the activity.
