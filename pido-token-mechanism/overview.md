# Overview

Pido maintains system stability and supports long-term operations through an innovative triple-token model. This model encourages participation and construction within the community by diversifying token applications to drive continuous innovation and growth of the platform. It aims not only to increase community activity but also to promote interaction and communication among users. By participating in voting, community events, and more, holders can earn rewards, further increasing user engagement and loyalty. The decentralized token mechanism is expected to accelerate the development of Pido and benefit more users.

## **Functions of the Three Tokens**

### **PIC (Pido Coin)**

* **Function**: PIC serves as a utility token, mainly used for circulation and transactions within the platform, similar to the role of traditional currency in an economic system.
* **Application**: It can be used to pay for service fees, purchase goods, or acquire resources and content on the platform.

### **PIT (Pido Token)**

* **Function**: PIT acts as a governance token, which is the medium for community participation and governance, closely related to having voting rights and influencing platform decisions.
* **Application**: Users holding PIT can participate in voting, express opinions on significant changes to the platform, proposal reviews, and governance policies.

### **PMT (Pido Merit Token)**

* **Function**: PMT is an influence token, designed to measure and reward the contributions and influence of community members, especially content creators.
* **Application**: Through PMT, the platform can quantify participants' contributions, provide corresponding incentives and rewards, and promote the production of high-quality content.

## **Advantages of the Triple-Token Model**

1. **Specialized Functions**: Designating specialized tokens for circulation, governance, and contribution makes the economic model more precise towards different dimensional goals.
2. **Encourage Participation**: The multi-token mechanism encourages user participation in platform activities by defining clear reward mechanisms, thereby increasing community activity and the overall value of the platform.
3. **Decentralized Governance**: The governance function of PIT tokens allows for decentralized governance, making the decision-making process more democratic and transparent.
4. **Innovation and Growth**: PMT tokens encourage the production of innovative and high-quality content, supporting users who make significant contributions to the platform, thereby promoting the platform's long-term growth.
5. **Risk Diversification**: The multi-token model allows users to choose investments based on their preferences and risk tolerance, thereby diversifying risk.

The triple-token model of Pido exemplifies its exploration of future economic models, aiming to create a multi-faceted, dynamic economic ecosystem. This economic model promotes collaboration and innovation among participants through market role segmentation and incentive measures, and supports the platform's sustainable development through decentralized governance.
