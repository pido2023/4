## The Core Token of Pido

PIC (Pido Coin) is the core utility and circulating token of Pido, designed specifically for the transaction of virtual assets and services within the platform. It is not only a settlement tool for community voting and exhibition activities, but also serves as a bridge connecting users to platform governance. It can be directly exchanged for the governance token PIT, granting you a voice in platform governance.
