# How to Earn PIC

On Pido, earning PIC is diversified and flexible. Here are the three main ways you can earn PIC, each providing different participation and acquisition paths for users.

## **System Task Output**

Pido regularly launches a series of system tasks designed to promote user engagement and community activity. Completing these tasks can earn you PIC tokens directly. System tasks are not only a transmission of platform value but also a reflection of user contribution being recognized and rewarded.

## **Crowdfunding USD Staking Output**

Users can support innovation and development within the platform by pledging USD to specific crowdfunding projects. Depending on the amount and duration of the pledge, users will receive PIC as a reward. This not only helps projects on the platform get the necessary financial support but also provides pledgers with the opportunity to earn PIC.&#x20;

This method is a junction of capital circulation and ecosystem support, promoting the healthy growth of the platform.

## **Unilateral PIT Staking Output**

PIT, as the governance token of Pido, is not only key to governance but can also be staked on its own to produce PIC. Users can periodically receive PIC as a return by locking in PIT tokens, reflecting their long-term commitment and support for the platform.&#x20;

Through unilateral PIT staking, users have the opportunity to increase their PIC assets while maintaining governance rights.

The above three methods provide channels for contributing to the platform on different levels, allowing every user to participate in the construction and development of the platform ecosystem according to their abilities and preferences. Through these paths, the PIC token acts not only as a reward mechanism but also promotes the growth and prosperity of the community.
