# PIC | Crowdfunding USD Staking

Within Pido, users can participate in crowdfunding projects by staking USD, thus supporting product design and the production of OEM factories. Here are the detailed rules for crowdfunding USD pledges:

## **Crowdfunding Participation Rules**

1. **Staking Cost:** Users need to pay a corresponding amount of USD to participate in crowdfunding. To purchase $$n$$ design/art products whose price is $$P$$, $$nP$$ USD must be paid.
2. **USD Lock-up:** The paid USD will be locked in the project budget pool. Only after the crowdfunding is successful, these funds will be delivered to the designers/artists and OEM factories.
3. **Crowdfunding Entry:** The crowdfunding entry remains open until the crowdfunding is successful, allowing users to participate at any time.
4. **Lock-up Period Choice:** Users can choose different lock-up periods, including one week, two weeks, one month, two months, and three months.
5. **Fund Status**: The amount of USD in the crowdfunding pool is not fixed and will change as users join and leave the crowdfunding.
6. **PIC Earnings**: Users will earn PIC tokens as returns while their USD is locked up until the lock-up period ends or the crowdfunding project is successful.

## **Yield Rate and Exit Mechanism**

1. **Annual Yield Rate**: Different lock-up periods will have different annual yield rates. The specific yield rate structure needs to be further provided.

| Lock-up Period | Annual Yield Rate |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| 1 week         | $$d_1$$           |
| 2 weeks        | $$d_2$$           |
| 1 month        | $$d_3$$           |
| 2 months       | $$d_4$$           |
| 3 months       | $$d_5$$           |

The specific numerical value of annual yield rates will be provided subsequently.

2. **Re-participation**: After exiting the crowdfunding, users can choose to participate again and reset the lock-up period.
3. **Earnings Guarantee**: Whether or not the crowdfunding project is successful, users will earn PIC returns during the period their USD is locked.

## **Notes**

1. Whether the crowdfunding is successful or not does not affect the right of users to earn PIC profits, but the success or failure of the project may affect users' decisions on whether to continue to pledge or withdraw USD.
2. The longer the lock-up period, the higher the annual yield rate users typically enjoy, which rewards the users for their long-term commitment.
3. The design of these rules aims to balance the enthusiasm of user participation with the stability of project funds while ensuring that users have clear expectations for the returns on their pledged funds.
