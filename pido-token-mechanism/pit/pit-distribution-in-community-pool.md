# PIT Distribution in Community Pool

## Overview of PIT Community Distribution

Pido has introduced a diversified PIT token allocation mechanism aimed at rewarding users through various community interactions and platform activities. Here is a detailed overview of the PIT community distribution:

1. &#x20;**Burn To Earn**
   * **Percentage**: 10%
   * **Total Amount**: 100,000,000
   * **Description**: Users can exchange their PIC tokens for PIT tokens. Through this mechanism, the PIC tokens are "burned," and in turn, users earn PIT.
2. **Bid To Earn**
   * **Percentage**: 16%
   * **Total Amount**: 160,000,000
   * **Description**: Users who bid on NFTs during design/art auctions have the opportunity to earn PIT tokens as rewards.
3. **Raise To Earn**
   * **Percentage**: 5%
   * **Total Amount**: 50,000,000
   * **Description**: Users earn PIT tokens when they purchase NFTs on a design/art crowdfunding platform.
4. **Transact To Earn**
   * **Percentage**: 15%
   * **Total Amount**: 150,000,000
   * **Description**: Users who successfully trade NFTs on the secondary market will earn PIT tokens as part of the transaction.
5. **Vote To Earn**
   * **Percentage**: 8%
   * **Total Amount**: 80,000,000
   * **Description**: Users who participate in community governance voting can earn PIT tokens, encouraging user participation in platform decision-making.
6. **Curate to Earn**
   * **Percentage**: 6%
   * **Total Amount**: 60,000,000
   * **Description**: Users who exhibit or promote NFT would be considered as curators and can earn PIT through discovering other designers/artists' works.

Through this community distribution mechanism, Pido not only increases the avenues through which users can hold PIT tokens but also promotes the activity and participation in the platform's ecosystem through different community activities and forms of interaction. These token distribution methods encourage users to take positive actions on the platform, thus building a self-motivating and self-growing community environment.
