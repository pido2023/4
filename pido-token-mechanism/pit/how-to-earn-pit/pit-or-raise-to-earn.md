# PIT | Raise to Earn

## **Mechanism Introduction**

The "Raise to Earn" model is a blend of crowdfunding and X2E-based rewards, where NFTs play a central role. Here is a detailed explanation of this process:

1. **NFT Minting and Reward Distribution**

* When consumers purchase non-limited edition NFTs through crowdfunding and receive the physical product after production, the corresponding NFT is minted to digitally represent the item. Upon completion of this transaction, both designers/artists and consumers are rewarded with PIT tokens.
* After a successful crowdfunding campaign, non-limited edition NFTs, as OEM products, are settled in fiat currency (USD or RMB).
* Designers/Artists must pay $$E_C$$ PIT tokens before uploading their NFT works.
* The minimum value of $$E_C$$ is influenced by the crowdfunding unit price and the target volume, which the designer/artist decides but must not be lower than this minimum value.
* For every NFT minted, corresponding PIT rewards are distributed to the designer/artist and consumer.

2. **Crowdfunding Pricing and User Contribution**

* The crowdfunding price of a design/art product is $$P$$, settled in fiat currency. Consumers pay $$G_i = n_iP$$ USD for $$n_i$$ units of the product.
* Each time a user contributes to the crowdfunding, the contribution amount $$H_i$$ is calculated as $$H_i = (k_2G_i + b_1)^{r_4}$$, where $$k_2$$ and $$b_1$$ are parameters, and $$0 < r_4 < 1$$ (initially set $$r_4=0.5$$).
* The more products a consumer purchases, the greater their contribution to the crowdfunding.

3. **PIT Holdings and Growth Coefficient**

* The total amount of PIT held by a user is $$N$$, with $$N'$$ being the staked PIT.
*   The PIT growth coefficient $$v(N,N')$$ is:

    $$
    v(N,N')=\begin{cases}{N'}^r & N \leq c\\{\big(\frac{cN'}{N}\big)}^r & N > c\end{cases}
    $$

    where $$c > 1,0<r<1$$.

4. **Crowdfunding Pool and Reward Calculations**

* When users pay USD for crowdfunding, the PIT crowdfunding pool is increased, consisting of the PIT prepaid by the designer/artist and PIT generated by the system.
*   The total PIT amount in the crowdfunding pool, $$I$$, is calculated as:

    $$
    I = k_3\bigg[\lambda +(1-\lambda)a_3^{-\frac{x}{y}}\bigg]\left(\sum H_i\sqrt \frac{E_C}{\sum H_i}\right)^2
    $$

    where $$k_3$$ and $$a_3 > 1$$ are parameters, and $$y$$ is the remaining PIT in the NFT minting pool, with an initial value of $$x+y=100,000,000$$.
* If a user exits the crowdfunding, their USD will be refunded, and the PIT in the crowdfunding pool will be reduced accordingly.
*   After a user exits, the remaining PIT in the crowdfunding pool, $$J$$, is:

    $$
    J = k_3\bigg[\lambda +(1-\lambda)a_3^{-\frac{x}{y}}\bigg]\left(\sum _{i \ne j}H_i\sqrt \frac{E_C}{\sum _{i \ne j}H_i}\right)^2
    $$

5. **Final PIT Reward Distribution**

* After the NFT is minted, designers/artists will receive $$15\%I\max\{v_0,v(N_d,N'_d)\}$$, where $$N_d'$$ is the PIT staked by the designer/artist.
* Consumers receive $$80\%I$$.
*   The individual reward for consumers is calculated as:

    $$
    80\%I\frac{n_i}{\sum n_i}\max \{v_0,v(N_c,N_c')\}
    $$

    where $$N_c'$$ is the PIT staked by the consumer, $$v_0<1$$ is a constant.

6. **Transaction Fee**: After the auction concludes, a transaction fee of $$5\%I$$ PIT tokens will be deducted from the reward pool.

## **NFT Upload Fee Algorithm**

1. **Base Variables**
   * The crowdfunding unit price for NFTs is set at $$P$$.
   * The target amount is set at $$n$$.
2. **Non-Linear Influence Functions**
   * Crowdfunding Unit Price Influence: $$V_{p} = d_{p}  \ln(P + 1)$$.
   * Target Amount Influence: $$V_{n} = d_{n} \ln(n+1)$$.
3.  **Integrate Base Upload Fee and Influences:** Combine the base upload fee $$E_{C0}$$ with the non-linear influences calculated above to determine a upload fee:

    $$
    E_C'=E_{C0}+V_p+V_n
    $$
4.  **Adjust for Market Conditions**: Optionally, include a dynamic adjustment factor $$\delta$$ that accounts for real-time market conditions and ensures platform competitiveness, we set $$\delta=0$$ initially.

    $$
    E_C=(1+\delta)E_C'
    $$
5. **Final Confirmation**:
   * If the upload fee is greater than or equal to $$E_C$$, confirm the fee.
   * If the upload fee is less than $$E_C$$, request an adjustment to at least meet $$E_C$$.

## Explanation and Analysis

This model suggests a sophisticated approach to managing a crowdfunding pool using a combination of fiat and cryptocurrency, where the value of the pool is dynamically adjusted based on user participation and the remaining PIT in a separate NFT minting pool. Here's a more detailed breakdown of the components and processes involved.

### Key Components

1. **NFT Minting and Reward Distribution**

* **NFT Minting**: NFT serves as a proof of ownership and include digital perks, authenticity verification, or other metadata about the physical product. This is designed to create a symbiotic relationship between designers/artists, consumers, and the Pido. By tying the NFT to the physical product, PIdo adds value to the purchase while also fostering a digital ecosystem through the use of blockchain technology.
* **Reward Distribution**: Once the physical product is delivered and the corresponding NFT is minted, both the designer/artist of the product and the consumer who made the purchase receive PIT tokens. Designers/Artists are incentivized to produce high-quality, desirable products because they receive rewards in both fiat currency and PIT tokens. Consumers are incentivized to purchase and support products because they receive both the physical item and an NFT that could appreciate in value, along with a reward in PIT tokens.
* **Designer/Artist Fee (**$$E_C​$$**)**: Designers/Artists are required to pay a fee in PIT tokens before they can upload their NFT works. This fee serves to filter out non-serious listings and ensures that only committed artists list their products.
* **Minimum Value of Designer/Artist Fee**: The minimum fee that designers/artists must pay is influenced by the crowdfunding unit price and the target volume for the NFTs, which the designer/artist sets. This means that the more valuable or numerous the NFTs are intended to be, the higher the minimum fee might be. The fees ensure that they are invested in the success of their products, potentially leading to a more curated and high-quality selection of NFTs on the platform. The commission structure allows the platform to sustain its operations and continue providing services to both designers/artists and consumers.

2. **Crowdfunding Pricing and Contribution**

* **Contribution Formula:** This formula for calculating user contribution $$H_i = (k_2G_i + b_1)^{r_4}$$ is designed to create a non-linear reward structure.&#x20;
* **Encouragement of Participation**: By rewarding any level of contribution, Pido encourages more users to participate, even if they can only afford a small amount.
* **Diminishing Returns**: The sub-linear relationship ($$r_4​<1$$) discourages excessive accumulation by a single consumer, as each additional unit purchased contributes less to their total $$H_i​$$ than the previous one. This can help prevent a situation where a few wealthy individuals dominate the crowdfunding process.
* **Fairness and Balance**: The use of a sub-linear formula aims to strike a balance between rewarding users for their contribution and keeping the crowdfunding process open and attractive to a broader base of consumers.
* **Strategic Participation**: Consumers need to strategize their participation by calculating the optimal number of units to purchase to maximize their contribution relative to their expenditure, considering the diminishing returns.

3. **PIT Held by Users (**$$N$$**) and PIT Staked (**$$N'$$**)**

These two variables affect the growth coefficient in the exchange process. The more PIT a user holds and stakes, the greater the discounts they may enjoy when exchanging for additional PIT. This encourages users to not only purchase and hold PIT but also to participate in staking, supporting network security and governance.

4. **Growth Coefficient (**$$v(N,N')$$**)**

The piecewise function in this formula ensures that when the PIT held by users is less than a certain threshold (determined by $$c$$), they can directly influence the number of PIT they obtain through the amount of PIT staked. When a user's holdings exceed this threshold, the exchange efficiency is reduced as the growth coefficient is inversely proportional to the holdings $$N$$.

5. **Crowdfunding Pool and Reward Calculations**

* **Crowdfunding Pool Increase:** When users contribute USD to a crowdfunding campaign, the amount of PIT in the crowdfunding pool increases. This pool consists of:
  * **PIT Prepaid by Designer/Artist**: This is the amount the designer/artist has paid to list their NFT works for crowdfunding, as discussed earlier.
  * **PIT Generated by the System**: This is an additional amount of PIT that the system creates, perhaps as a form of incentive or matching to encourage crowdfunding participation.
* The term $$\sum Hi​$$ is the sum of all individual contributions to the crowdfunding pool. The square root term $$\sqrt {\frac{E_C}{\sum H_i}​​​}$$ normalizes the designer/artist's fee by the total contributions, suggesting that the impact of the designer/artist’s fee on the pool is inversely related to the total contributions.
* The entire expression inside the parentheses is squared, indicating a non-linear relationship between this normalized fee and the pool size. The exponent $$−\frac{x}{y}​$$ applied to $$a_3​$$ suggests a decay function that diminishes the pool as the ratio of $$x$$ to $$y$$ changes, ensuring the pool does not go empty quickly.
* After a user exits, the remaining PIT in the crowdfunding pool $$J$$ is recalculated without their contribution $$H_j​$$,  which is similar to the one used to calculate $$I$$ but specifically excludes the exiting user's contribution, $$H_j​$$, from the sum of contributions $$\sum H_i​$$.
* The part $$a_3^{-\frac{x}{y}}$$ in the formula indicates that as the remaining amount of PIT decreases, i.e., $$y$$ becomes smaller, the rewards will fall. As $$x$$ grows or $$y$$ shrinks, this will serve as a regulatory mechanism to prevent overinflation of the pool's value and ensure the scarcity and value of the PIT tokens.
* The parameter $$\lambda=0.2$$ ensures that even if the remaining amount of the token pool $$y$$ is very small, the output speed will not drop to 0, which prevents the production from coming to a complete halt.
* The term $$1-\lambda$$ ensures that at the beginning, when $$x=0$$, the output factor is 1, which means that the token's production speed is at its maximum initially.

6. **Final PIT Reward Distribution**

* The reward distribution mechanism is designed to incentivize both designers/artists and consumers to participate in the NFT minting process and to stake PIT tokens. By staking more PIT, both designers/artists and consumers increase their potential rewards.
* The individual reward for each consumer is a fraction of the total 80% PIT rewards allocated to consumers, weighted by the amount of PIT they have staked. The denominator $$\sum n_i$$ normalizes the individual reward across all contributing consumers, ensuring that the rewards are distributed proportionally to the amount staked.
* The specific allocation of rewards—15% to artists and 80% to consumers—aims to favor consumers slightly in the distribution process, which might attract more consumers to fund the NFT projects.

### Strategies and Incentives

#### **For Designers/Artists**

* **Quality and Originality**: Encourage designers/artists to create high-quality and original products that will attract more consumers and increase the success rate of crowdfunding campaigns.
* **Entry Fee Investment**: Designers/Artists pay an entry fee in PIT tokens to list their designs/artworks, incentivizing them to promote their campaigns to ensure they recoup this investment and earn profits.
* **Profit Sharing**: By receiving a percentage of the PIT tokens from successful crowdfunding, designers/artists are motivated to maintain active participation and innovation within Pido.

**For Consumers**

* **Early Support Rewards**: Consumers who participate early in crowdfunding campaigns receive more significant rewards in PIT tokens, promoting early and active engagement with new products.
* **Loyalty Bonuses**: Earn bonuses for repeat contributions or staking PIT tokens, which will offer higher returns for long-term supporters.
* **Exclusive Access**: Consumers who hold or stake enough PIT tokens will gain early or exclusive access to limited edition products or special editions, adding a layer of exclusivity and incentive to hold the tokens.

### Long-term Participation

#### For Designers/Artists

1. **Continuous Revenue Stream**: Designers/Artists receive a percentage of the PIT tokens for every NFT minted. This offers a continuous revenue stream beyond the initial sale of their designs/artworks, incentivizing them to create and upload more designs/artworks.
2. **Community Building**: Through participating in a platform that rewards their contributions, designers/artists can build a community of followers who are invested in their success, leading to a more stable and predictable income.
3. **Enhanced Reputation**: Successful designs/artworks that lead to higher PIT rewards can also enhance the reputation of designers/artists, potentially leading to more opportunities both within and outside of Pido.
4. **Staking Benefits**: The system will offer additional benefits or higher rewards for designers/artists who stake more PIT tokens, encouraging them to reinvest their earnings into the platform.

#### For Consumers

1. **Token Appreciation**: Over time, if Pido gains popularity and the demand for PIT tokens increases, the value of the tokens received as rewards could appreciate, providing a potential investment return.
2. **Exclusive Access**: Consumers who participate more actively may gain early or exclusive access to new products, special editions, or unique NFTs, which can be a significant draw for enthusiasts and collectors.
3. **Voting Rights or Influence**: Holding and staking PIT tokens will grant consumers voting rights or a say in platform decisions, such as which designs/artworks get produced next, further investing them in the ecosystem.
4. **Enhanced Rewards for Staking**: Consumers who stake their PIT tokens could receive larger rewards, encouraging long-term holding and reducing the propensity to sell tokens immediately after earning them.
