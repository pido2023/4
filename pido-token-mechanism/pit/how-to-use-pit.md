# How to Use PIT

PIT tokens have multiple uses on Pido, which form the foundation of the entire ecosystem. Here are the main uses of PIT tokens and how they provide rewards and incentives to users.

## **Designers/Artists Listing Auction Items**

* Designers/Artists must pay PIT tokens to list limited edition works and start auctions.
* The PIT tokens paid have a minimum threshold, but no maximum limit, which is decided by the designer/artist.
* The PIT tokens paid will be distributed to all consumers participating in the auction as rewards along with PIT tokens in the system.

## Designers/Artists **Listing Crowdfunding Items**

* Designers/Artists must pay PIT tokens to list unlimited edition works and start crowdfunding.
* The PIT tokens paid also have a minimum threshold, set by the designer/artist.
* The PIT tokens paid will be distributed to all consumers participating in crowdfunding as rewards along with PIT tokens in the system.

## **NFT Secondary Transactions**:

* In the secondary market, NFT transactions can only be conducted with PIT tokens.
* Users must use PIT tokens to bid on NFTs they own and pay Harberger Tax, a tax based on self-declared market value designed to promote asset liquidity.

## **Purchasing PMT**

* Consumers need to use PIT tokens to purchase PMTs issued by different designers/artists.
* The price of PMTs will rise with the increase in issuance volume.

## **Staking Yields**

* Users can stake PIT tokens to earn staking yields.
* The yield will be distributed in the form of PIC tokens.
* Only staked PIT tokens can be used to calculate various action weights, which may affect a user's influence and earnings on the platform.

## **Liquidity Mining**

* Users can stake PIT tokens to participate in liquidity mining.
* The mining output will also be distributed in the form of PIT tokens.

## **Community Governance**

* The number of PIT tokens held by a user can be used for community governance voting, with the holding amount acting as the voting weight.
* This allows users to participate in the decision-making process and influence the development direction of the platform.

These uses and mechanisms of PIT tokens are designed to create a self-reinforcing ecosystem where every interaction by the users could bring benefits to both the individual and the community. These uses and incentive measures are designed to ensure the sustainability of the platform and increase user engagement and investment over the long term.
