# PIT

PIT (Pido Token) , as the governance token in Pido, plays a crucial role, since its setup and distribution strategy have a direct impact on the platform's economic model and user behavior. Pido provides a governance mechanism through PIT, allowing users to participate in the decision-making process and influence the direction of platform development.&#x20;

The scarcity of PIT and its diverse uses (such as proposal voting, payment of fees, reward distribution, etc.) are aimed at creating a balanced economic ecosystem that ensures the platform's sustainable development.&#x20;

As PIT has a governance function, holders can participate in platform decision-making, including but not limited to voting on proposals and discussions on platform updates. Additionally, the trading capability of PIT in the secondary market provides liquidity convenience for holders.&#x20;

### **PIT Supply Strategy**

The total supply of PIT tokens is fixed initially, with a total of 1,000,000,000 tokens.

As the platform develops and the user base grows, new PIT tokens will be issued gradually.
