# PIT Burning

The PIT token burning mechanism is designed to ensure the stability and sustainability of the token supply while increasing the token's scarcity, potentially driving up the market value of the token. Below are the six main ways of the PIT token burning mechanism.

## Burn to Earn

Each exchange operation will deduct a 5% fee, of which 2% goes to the platform and the remaining 3% of the rewards will be burned.

## Bid to Earn

A 5% fee will be deducted from the PIT rewards produced by each bidding operation, with 2% going to the platform and 3% being burned.

## Raise to Earn

After crowdfunding to purchase non-limited-edition NFTs, a 5% fee will be deducted from the PIT rewards generated upon successful minting, with 2% going to the platform and 3% being burned.

## Transact to Earn

When successfully trading NFTs on the secondary market, a 5% fee will be deducted from the PIT rewards generated, with 2% going to the platform and 3% being burned.

## Vote to Earn

After each successful vote, a 5% fee will be deducted from the PIT rewards generated, with 2% going to the platform and 3% being burned.

## Curate to Earn

When a transaction is completed through the curator's page, a 5% fee will be deducted from the system rewards earned by the buyer, with 2% going to the platform and 3% being burned.

These burning mechanisms combine the objectives of rewarding active users and reducing the token supply to create a healthy economic cycle, ensuring the token's stable appreciation over the long term. Through this approach, Pido can balance the creation of new tokens with the destruction of old ones, thereby avoiding excessive inflation and maintaining the health of the token economy. At the same time, this also provides an incentive mechanism, encouraging users to participate more actively in various platform activities.
